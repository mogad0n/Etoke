Adds a feature to enable calling for an `@etoke` on the channel which people should be able to join using `@imin` the timer should auto-expire in `x` minutes and start the countdown anyway. Or the the person (only that person) who called the etoke can force-start it using `@blaze` .

`@optin` and `@optout` can be used to pick whether or not you will be notified during said etoke.



###TODO

Add stats monitoring and custom responses for a nick's `n`th etoke.
